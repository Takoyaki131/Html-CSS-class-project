      <h1>Important People of the Process</h1>
      <h2>Sam Hinkie</h2>
      <img src="../assets/hinkie.jpg" alt="Sam Hinkie">
      <p>The creator of the process. Hinkie first began his career with the Houston Rockets after graduating from Stanford Graduate School of Business and worked under Daryl Morey where he promoted the use of advanced statistics. He became GM of the 76ers in 2013 and traded away several veterans and leading to the speculation that the 76ers were tanking (losing on purpose) to gain high draft picks. During his time of the Process, Hinkie was responsible for drafting key players in the era of the process including Michael Carter Williams, Joel Embiid, Dario Saric and signing Robert Covington.</p>

      <h2>Joel Embiid</h2>
      <img src="../assets/embiid.jpg" alt="Joel 'The process' Embiid">
      <p>The most successful player drafted by Sam Hinkie, Embiid hails from Yaounde Cameroon and was recruited to the Americas by former NBA player Luc Mbah a Moute. From the age of 16, Joel devoted himself to the game and became a 5 star prospect and committed to the University of Kansas and played for one year before being drafted 3rd overall. In October of 2016, Embiid finally made his NBA debut after being sidelined with injuries for the last two years. Embiid is the new era center, possesing guard skills in his 7'2" frame. His smooth low post footwork coupled with his soft jumpshot, along with superstar personallity makes him one of the faces of the association. Joel, nicknamed "The Process", is the cornerstone of the 76ers and symbolizes what awaits teams when they trust their own process. </p>

      <h2>Ben Simmons</h2>
      <img src="../assets/simmons.jpg" alt="Ben Simmons">
      <p>Dubbed LeBron 2.0, Simmons was the first draft pick in the post Hinkie era. A Australian who came to the Americas at the age of 17. Simmons attended LSU for 1 year before becomming the consensus number 1 overall pick to the 76ers. A 6'10" playing guard, Simmons is a 2 way monster able to defend all 5 positions while running the offence. Ben is a walking triple double and along with Embiid are the 1-2 punch that makes the 76ers a title threat every year.</p>

      <h2>Tony Wroten</h2>
      <img src="../assets/wroten.jpg" alt="Tony Wroten celebratesa win in Philadelphia">
      <p>Wroten found his way to Philly via trade with the Memphis Grizzlies. In his first career start he posted a triple double in a overtime thriller vs the Houston Rockets with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. His season was cut short due to an torn ACL. Wroten's history in Philadelphia is best known for creating the phrase itself "Trust the Process" which he mentioned in an ESPN <a target="_blank" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2729018-the-definitive-history-of-trust-the-process">article</a> written by Pablo Torre.   </p>
